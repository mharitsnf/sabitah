Harits: That boat... [speed=1] You're *Rokuhara's* son right?
- Yes
	Harits: I knew it! You two look exactly the same!

Harits: Anyway, I just want to give you this since you helped the mayor earlier.
Harits: I hope this helps with your adventure.
Harits: Also, the mayor says that you are free to visit this island whenever you need to.
